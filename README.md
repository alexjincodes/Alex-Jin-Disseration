# Alex Jin Honours Dissertation

<p>
In my Honours year, I was fortunate to be placed in a project looking at regional lung function using MRI. Specifically, using Oxygen-Enhanced MRI we were gathering data on general function of the lung while under different tests. 
</br>
My part in the project was working closely image data from patients and using MatLab software to determine any trends that may arise. While also working with the MatLab code, I closely monitored the imaging process using the MRI constantly checking all machine parameters were in check and experimental conditions were being met. In my time working with the project I was able to develop a professionalism working with high level medical professionals that work at the Auckland hospital. I also reported directly to two supervisors Dr Beau Pontre and Dr Kelly Burrowes where I was able to build confidence in expressing my personal work which I found very beneficial to my growth.
